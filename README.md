## Installing Vendor Libraries

To resolve issues with dependencies, such as, if an import
cannot be resolved, a library may need to be added.

To add a library, open the command pallete in WPIlib's VSCode, and navigate to the following:
Manage Vendor Libraries > Install new libraries (online)

From here, paste the URL for the json file associated with the library.
Libraries can be found [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vscode-overview/3rd-party-libraries.html#libraries)
